          Micro-Token Manifesto: Issuance, Freedom, and Responsibility          

                                October 24, 2024                                

We,  the participants of the new decentralized movement, believe that the future
belongs  to communities, not corporations. We declare the beginning of a new era
in  the  crypto  industry  - the era of micro-tokens, where each participant has
equal   rights   to  create  and  manage  value,  unrestrained  by  the  initial
concentration  of  wealth  and  power.  This is the micro-token manifesto, where
issuance becomes free, transparent, and fair.                                   

                                        ~                                 

                                 Our Principles                                 

                                1. No Privileges                                

          We  reject  the  idea  of  pre-minting  and  privileges  for          
          investors.   Every   participant   is   equal,   and   their          
          contribution  determines  their right to issue micro-tokens,          
          not  the  amount  of  initially  invested  capital.  We  are          
          creating  a world where there are no "whales," and the right          
          to issue is distributed among active community members.               

                        2. Participation-based Issuance                         

          The  right  to  issue  micro-tokens  is not just a technical          
          process;  it's  proof  of  engagement. Everyone who actively          
          participates  in  the project's life gets the opportunity to          
          issue  micro-tokens,  symbolizing  that participation itself          
          creates value.                                                        

                            3. Responsible Issuance                             

          Issuing  micro-tokens  requires collateral. This is a pledge          
          of  responsibility  for  each  issuer,  a guarantee that the          
          value  created  by  the community has a sustainable economic          
          foundation.  We  believe  that  everyone  who  issues should          
          contribute their share - to bear responsibility for creating          
          and maintaining value.                                                

                            4. Backing and Liquidity                            

          In  our movement, every micro-token is backed by assets. The          
          ability  to  return  micro-tokens  to  the  reserve fund and          
          reclaim  the  collateral  creates a sustainable system where          
          value  is  not  diluted  but supported and strengthened with          
          each new step of the community.                                       

                            5. Freedom of Redemption                            

          We  ensure  the  freedom  to  redeem  micro-tokens  from the          
          reserve fund, provided collateral is deposited. This creates          
          stability and trust, making micro-tokens a reliable means of          
          exchange  and  interaction.  The more collateral, the higher          
          the trust, the stronger the community.                                

                              6. Sustainable Usage                              

          A  project providing services for micro-tokens is obliged to          
          transfer  a  portion of the micro-tokens to the reserve fund          
          without  withdrawing  the  collateral.  We  are  creating an          
          economy  where  the  use of micro-tokens returns them to the          
          system, ensuring long-term stability and growth.                      

                                        ~                                 

We  call on all who believe in decentralization, fairness, and responsibility to
join  our  micro-token  movement.  We  are  creating  a new world where value is
determined not by capital, but by the contribution of each participant. Issuance
should  be  a  responsibility,  liquidity - a guarantee, and participation - the
main asset.                                                                     

                Join us to build a fair and sustainable economy                 
                        of the future with micro-tokens.

                                        ~
